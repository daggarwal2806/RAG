[2025-03-18 22:34:01,912] DEBUG rag_query_processor:59 - LLM Response: Answer:

In the UK, 'Human Rights are Fundamental' (HRA) Act 2000 - The Human Rights Bill

    In the UK, 'Human Rights are Fundamental' (HRA) Act 2000 is an act that enacts human rights which are considered most fundamental.

In the USA, 'Individuals' constitutional rights vs. 'Group Rights'

    In the US constitution  - The individuals' rights are defined in Article I- Bill of Rights - Section I: Congress shall make no law respecting a person's religion, or prohibiting such acts as are espoused with religious zeal. - Section II: The right of the people to keep and bear arms, under reasonable regulations, shall not be infringed - Section III: A person is entitled to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness. 

    The group rights (or "group liberties") are defined in the Constitution, not just as part of any individual's rights but also as an inherent attribute.

    The key issue remains: is it the group rights that are recognized, or a mix of both? The US Supreme Court has consistently held individuals have their constitutional rights protected to the utmost extent, under the "Bill of Rights" established within the Bill of Rights - Article I.

    The US Constitution was drafted in 1787-1791. That period established the group rights as part of its fundamental principles.

    However, the 'Bill of Rights' is a separate document from the US Constitution. The Bill of Rights - Article I states:

    "The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others that are precisely alike."

    The Bill of Rights - Section II, Clause 1: "No State shall make or enforce any law which SHALL AINDE OF THE CONSTITUTION FOR INADIOUS."

    The Bill of Rights - Section III, Clause 1: "The people have the right to keep and bear arms for themselves."

    In the US Constitution, The Bill of Rights has been interpreted as a fundamental document that provides for individual rights.

    One such understanding is the  Supreme Court case **United States v. Yaggar** (1978), stating that the US Constitutional Bill of Rights is a fundamental document and is essential in determining what rights are protected under the Constitution.

    Therefore, In comparison to Norway Constitutional 'Group Rights as Individual Rights'   -  No

In the USA Constitution vs. Norway Constitutional Act: fundamental rights to difference.
