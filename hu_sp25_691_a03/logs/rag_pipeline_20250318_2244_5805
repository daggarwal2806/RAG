        Question:
        Compare the fundamental rights in USA Constitution vs. Norway Constitution.
        
[2025-03-18 22:45:11,181] DEBUG rag_query_processor:62 - LLM Response: Answer:
The United States Constitution and Norway's constitution do not share the same fundamental rights. However, they have some commonalities in respect to individual freedoms and human basic rights.

The fundamental rights of the United States Constitution are:

1. Right to freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures (4th Amendment).
2. The right to due process, as stated in the Fifth Amendment.
3. The freedom of religion (1st Amend).
4. Freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures under the 4th Amendment (2nd Amendment)
5. Right to due process and freedom from self-incrimination (4th Amendment).
6. Freedom of speech, press, and assembly.

Norway's Constitution has the following fundamental rights:

1. Freedom of thought or belief (Article 22, Fundamental Rights).
2. Right to freedom of expression as stated in Article 24 (Fundamental Rights).
3. Freedom from arbitrary detention.

The following rights are common to both:
1. Right to freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures (2nd Amendment).
2. Freedom of speech, press, and assembly.

While Norway has its own right to freedom from arbitrary detention (Article 23), this is not mentioned in the USA Constitution. Additionally, Norway's freedom of thought or belief (Article 22) and freedom from arbitrary detention are not mentioned in the USA Constitution.

While Norway has its own right to freedom of government (Article 5) and the fundamental rights are not explicitly listed but can be interpreted.

It is essential to note that while Norway does not have the same fundamental rights as the USA Constitution, both countries share some commonalities in term of individual freedoms and human basic rights. Therefore, the fundamental differences between these two constitutions is more evident than similarities.

In fact, when Norway  was a member of the European Union in 1995, they were one of the first EU countries to adopt a constitutional framework. 

The Norway's Constitution was revised in 2015, and it is more aligned with the EU. The 2015 version adopted a new constitutional framework as part of the EU integration process. As previously mentioned, the United States is still not a member.
